This guide covers how to create a bot application and get the bot token to configure your resources.

- Create a new application from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on 'Bot' on the left navigation bar and enable the bot. Then copy the Bot Token.
- Congrats ðŸŽ‰ you now have the bot token. See the below on inviting the bot into your guild (server), this is likely needed for FiveM scripts.


- Now in the 'General Information' tab copy the 'Client ID' and replace `CLIENT_ID_HERE` in the below template.
```sh
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID_HERE&scope=bot
```
