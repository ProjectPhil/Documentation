To search for processes using a specific port run the following commands. This can be useful if you need to end/stop a service running on a specific port. To do this follow the below instructions.

Run the `lsof` command below, change the port if needed to what you need.
```
lsof -i tcp:3000
```
You'll get the results listed like [this](https://weblutions.com/i/6tpSLS.png).

Look under the **PID** column and copy that process ID into the below command to stop the process.

```
kill 9506
```
This command ends/stops the process so it is no longer running.
